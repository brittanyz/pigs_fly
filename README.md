# Tree Jumper

### Background
This game will be a slightly more complex implementation of Google's dinosaur game. This is a 1-player game that plays out over a moving landscape. The player will encounter obstacles (trees) to jump over collecting points along the way. There will be birds flying overhead that he/she can catch for extra points. The further the player gets the faster the obstacles will move, making it easier to clear the trees when jumping but much harder to predict timing and catch birds simultaneously. The player can choose to turn the sound off if he/she prefers. When the game is over your score will be displayed as well as your highest score.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
I've used strictly vanilla JavaScript in this project in an effort to utilize all that
the language has to offer in its purest form.
