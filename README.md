# JavaScript Project

### Background
This game will be a slightly more complex implementation of google's dinosaur game. This is a 1-player game that plays out over a moving landscape. The player will encounter obstacles to jump over collecting points along the way.  The further the player gets the faster he will move and the harder it will be to avoid the obstacles.

### Functionality
Users will be able to
* start, pause, and reset the game
* jump to avoid obstacles

In addition this project will include an about modal describing the rules of the game and a production README.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
Honestly, at this point I have absolutely no idea how I am going to build this...

### Timeline
Phase 1: Introduction and help modal
Phase 2: Implement the moving landscape
Phase 3: Jumping, any visual representation of points, and Game Over
